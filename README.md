=========

A not-exactly-a-fork for Sakai CLE work and experiments.

This is intended to track CLE trunk-all in master and the release branches in places like 2.9.x. The point is
to have a safe place to do wide-ranging tests or cleanup across all modules without needing to commit to all
of the directories in the SVN repository or manage the many externals.
